=============

BetMO or Bet Mobile is a Android application that enables users to have access with government procurement data. The user could be able to 
see the list of the bidders of different procured items. He/she then can choose by betting on the business owner whom he/she thinks deserve to
win the procurement process.

He/she can keep track of the bet items. On the event that her bet matches the actual winner, points will be added to her Kabantay stats.
There will be kabantay leaderboards showing the users who bet on the most businesses correctly.

The main idea of the application is to show the users the procurement data and at the same time give them the feel of being part of the process
since citizens are not really part of the deciding body in the actual procurement process. A lot of scenarios can spark the filipino community's
curiosity about the procurement process i.e When the people's choice (most number of bets) is not the same with the award recipient.

It was once said that "The biggest enemy we all face is not fear -- that’s the famous saying -- it’s doubt." So why not put that doubt into
good use and let the filipino community be curious about what is the process behind procurement.
